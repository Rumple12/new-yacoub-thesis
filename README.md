# new-yacoub-thesis

For the full development/report process, see: [docs/plans/new-yacoub-14-step-process.md](docs/plans/new-yacoub-14-step-process.md)

## What this repository is

This repository contains the implementation, planning documents, and report-support material for the **new-yacoub** bachelor thesis plan.

**new-yacoub** means:

- the original broader Yacoub/Obid thesis scope has been narrowed
- **Yacoub's thesis is the primary delivery target**
- only the **minimum Obid-compatible workflow, safety, and contract layers** are included
- the project is intentionally kept small, measurable, and pass-oriented

This repository is **not** a full dual-thesis implementation target.

---

## Primary objective

Complete Yacoub's thesis in a narrowed but complete form.

This includes:

- self-hosted n8n baseline
- Docker-based local runtime
- middleware/API bridge
- one sensor/event path
- one actuator/action path
- latency, RAM, CPU, and thermal/resource measurement support
- a reportable evaluation flow

---

## Secondary objective

Implement only the minimum Obid-compatible layer required for:

- workflow integration
- safety/validation
- shared contract definition
- evaluation support
- future handoff

This minimum layer is limited to:

- one workflow
- one prompt set
- one memory choice
- one JSON contract boundary
- one validation rule
- one human approval checkpoint

---

## Narrowed scope

The thesis focuses on **one complete end-to-end IoT scenario**.

Current intended scenario:

- temperature event
- middleware pushes event to n8n
- workflow decides whether a fan action is needed
- validation/approval checks the action
- middleware executes `/fan/on` or `/fan/off`
- metrics are logged

### Explicit non-goals

The following are out of scope unless the primary thesis is already complete:

- broad multi-agent systems
- elaborate ReAct expansion
- multiple memory strategies
- multiple devices/models
- deep n8n internals modification
- broad guardrail research
- heavy observability stacks such as Prometheus/Grafana
- early MCP integration

---

## Current status

The repository is currently in the **planning + scaffold phase**.

What exists now:

- repo structure
- thesis planning documents
- Antigravity workspace rules/workflows/skill
- narrowed implementation plan
- ongoing scope and report-support notes

What does **not** exist yet:

- Docker baseline
- middleware implementation
- workflow exports
- safety implementation
- measurement scripts
- evaluation results

---

## Repo structure

### High-priority implementation areas

- `infrastructure/`  
  Runtime, Docker, local self-hosted n8n, deployment assumptions, monitoring hooks

- `middleware/`  
  Python API, mock/real sensor path, webhook bridge, actuator endpoints

- `evaluation/`  
  Datasets, result files, measurement outputs, evaluation protocol

- `docs/`  
  Thesis planning, decisions, report support, architecture notes

### Minimum integration only

- `cognitive_logic/`  
  One workflow, one prompt set, one memory choice

- `safety_layer/`  
  One validation path, one approval path, one blocked/unsafe case

- `shared_interfaces/`  
  JSON schemas, example payloads, contract boundary between middleware and workflow logic

---

## Source-of-truth hierarchy

Use this order when making decisions:

1. `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md`
2. `docs/ongoing/yacoub-scope.md`
3. `docs/ongoing/integration-contract.md`
4. `docs/decisions.md`
5. historical/reference plan files under `docs/plans/`

Important:

- `docs/plans/obid-project-plan.md` is **reference-only**
- `docs/plans/supervisor-brief.md` must be interpreted through the narrowed new-yacoub scope

---

## How Antigravity should treat this repo

Antigravity is the **main IDE and planning environment** for this repository.

It should:

- prioritize Yacoub-complete over Obid-complete
- keep the scope locked to the new-yacoub plan
- prefer one complete vertical slice over many partial systems
- update planning/specification files before broad implementation when things are unclear

Antigravity should **not**:

- expand the repo back into the original broader Yacoub/Obid plan
- introduce broad multi-agent design
- modify n8n core unless explicitly required
- introduce MCP in phase 0

Relevant workspace controls live in:

- `.agents/rules/`
- `.agents/workflows/`
- `.agents/skills/`

---

## How Codex should treat this repo

Codex is a **reviewer/fixer** for this repository, not the main planner.

Use Codex for:

- audit/review of scope and diffs
- spotting schema drift
- checking missing tests/metrics
- making small targeted repairs

Keep Codex behavior narrow:

- `audit-review` thread = critique and inspection only
- `repair-fix` thread = bounded fixes only

Codex should not silently redesign the thesis architecture.

---

## Working style

This project should be built in **small vertical slices**.

Preferred order:

1. planning/specification lock
2. local n8n baseline
3. middleware baseline
4. contract baseline
5. deterministic baseline path
6. minimal workflow path
7. minimal safety path
8. metrics/evaluation
9. report writing from evidence

Every meaningful step should be:

- testable
- commit-worthy
- small enough to review

---

## Git discipline

Use:

- one feature = one branch
- one clean checkpoint = one commit

Do not batch many unrelated AI-generated changes into one commit.

---

## Report alignment

This repo is structured to support the official MIUN thesis template.

The report will later be built around:

- Introduction
- Theory
- Methodology
- Choice of approach
- Implementation
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusions
- Appendix A: Source Code

The repo exists to produce **evidence** for those chapters.

---

## Notes

If there is a conflict between:
- a broad historical plan
- a cool technical idea
- and the narrowed thesis implementation plan

the **new-yacoub implementation plan wins**.
