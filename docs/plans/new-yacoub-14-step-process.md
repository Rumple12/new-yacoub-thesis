# New Yacoub 14-Step Process

This document defines the full development and report process for the **new-yacoub** thesis.

The process is intentionally narrow. It exists to keep the project aligned with the Yacoub-first thesis goal while preserving only the minimum Obid-compatible integration needed for a valid end-to-end system.

---

## Step 1 - Lock the thesis goal, scope, and research questions

### Chapter focus

- Chapter 1 - Introduction
- Chapter 2 - Theory

### Chapter 1 deliverables

- background and motivation
- problem statement
- aim
- research questions
- scope and limitations
- usage of AI tools section
- division of work section
- chapter outline

### Chapter 1 feeds from

- `docs/ongoing/project-overview.md`
- `docs/ongoing/research-questions.md`
- `docs/ongoing/yacoub-scope.md`
- `docs/ongoing/obid-minimum-integration.md`
- `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md`
- `docs/decisions.md`

### Chapter 2 deliverables

- initial theory boundaries

This step exists to stop the project from drifting back into the old broader Yacoub/Obid plan.

### Work to complete

- `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md`
- `docs/ongoing/project-overview.md`
- `docs/ongoing/yacoub-scope.md`
- `docs/ongoing/obid-minimum-integration.md`
- `docs/ongoing/research-questions.md`
- `docs/ongoing/report-outline.md`
- `docs/n8n-version.md`
- `docs/decisions.md`

### Locked research questions

1. Can a self-hosted n8n-based IoT system run in a resource-constrained environment with acceptable latency?
2. What RAM, CPU, and thermal/resource effects are observed during operation?
3. Can a minimal workflow/safety layer safely mediate one physical action?
4. How does a deterministic baseline compare to an agent-enhanced workflow on the same task?

### Scope lock

The project is limited to:

- one scenario
- one sensor/event path
- one action path
- one middleware bridge
- one deterministic baseline
- one minimal agent-enhanced path
- one validation/approval path
- one evaluation loop

### Evidence produced

- locked scope
- research questions
- decision log
- report outline
- n8n version pin
- scope documents
- narrowed implementation plan

## Step 3 - Build the local n8n baseline

### Chapter focus

- Chapter 4 - Choice of approach
- Chapter 5 - Implementation

### Chapter 4 deliverables

- local self-hosted n8n vs broader/cloud-heavy alternatives
- why the local baseline comes before Raspberry Pi

### Chapter 4 feeds from

- `docs/decisions.md`
- `docs/n8n-version.md`
- `infrastructure/docker/`

### Chapter 5 deliverables

- infrastructure setup
- self-hosted n8n runtime
- reproducibility instructions

### Chapter 5 feeds from

- `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml`
- `infrastructure/docker/.env.example`
- `README.md`

### Goal

Get the workflow engine running locally before involving hardware complexity.

### Work to complete

- create the local infrastructure baseline
- create `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml`
- create `infrastructure/docker/.env.example`
- add basic local n8n startup instructions
- note the n8n version/image used in `docs/n8n-version.md`

### What this proves

This proves that the thesis has a reproducible local runtime.

### Evidence produced

- Docker files
- local n8n startup logs
- n8n version pin
- screenshots of running n8n
- basic run instructions

## Step 4 - Build the middleware skeleton

### Chapter focus

- Chapter 3 - Methodology
- Chapter 5 - Implementation

### Chapter 3 deliverables

- how manual testing was performed
- how mock sensor data was used before hardware

### Chapter 3 feeds from

- `middleware/tests/manual-test-notes.md`
- `docs/decisions.md`

### Chapter 5 deliverables

- middleware design
- API bridge
- sensor input path
- actuator endpoint path

### Chapter 5 feeds from

- `middleware/`
- `middleware/tests/manual-test-notes.md`
- `docs/architecture/README.md`

### Goal

Build the technical backbone of Yacoub's thesis: the bridge between sensor/action logic and n8n.

### Work to complete

- create the first minimal Python API structure in `middleware/`
- `middleware/api/app.py`
- `middleware/api/routes.py`
- `middleware/gpio/mock_sensor.py`
- `middleware/webhooks/n8n_sender.py`

Initial endpoints:

- `POST /sensor-event`
- `POST /fan/on`
- `POST /fan/off`
- `GET /status`

At this stage, mock sensor data is fine. Development starts on PC first; Raspberry Pi comes later as Tier 1.5 validation.

### What this proves

This proves that the system has a controlled execution layer and that workflow logic does not directly control hardware.

### Evidence produced

- middleware source files
- example request/response logs
- terminal outputs
- manual test notes

---

## Step 5 - Define the shared contract layer

### Chapter focus

### Goal

Lock the boundary between Yacoub's runtime side and the minimum Obid-compatible workflow/safety side.

### Work to complete

- `shared_interfaces/json-schema/agent-action.schema.json`
- `shared_interfaces/examples/sensor-event.example.json`
- `shared_interfaces/examples/fan-on.example.json`
- `shared_interfaces/examples/blocked-action.example.json`
- `docs/ongoing/integration-contract.md`
- `docs/architecture/README.md`

### What this proves

This proves that the system communicates through a defined interface instead of informal assumptions.

### Evidence produced

- schemas
- example payloads
- integration contract
- architecture notes

### Goal

Create the baseline that the agent-enhanced workflow will be compared against.

### Work to complete

- create one n8n workflow with no agent reasoning

- rule: if temperature is above threshold, request `fan_on`
- otherwise request `fan_off` or no action
- call the middleware endpoint
- log the result
- store the exported workflow JSON
- store a short explanation of nodes
- store a workflow screenshot

### What this proves

This gives the thesis a controlled comparison anchor.

- `cognitive_logic/workflows/agent-minimal.md`
- `cognitive_logic/prompts/system-prompt-v1.md`
- `cognitive_logic/memory/memory-choice-v1.md`

Keep it limited to:

- one workflow
- one prompt set
- one memory choice
- one decision path
- structured output following the shared contract

### What this proves

This proves the system can support a minimal agent-enhanced path without becoming a full Obid thesis implementation.

### Evidence produced

- workflow export
- prompt file
- memory rationale
- structured output logs
- screenshots

- allowed case
- blocked case
- approval screenshot/log

- `evaluation/results/processed/summary_latency.csv`
- `evaluation/results/processed/summary_resources.csv`
- `evaluation/results/processed/safety_outcomes.csv`
- `evaluation/results/processed/baseline_vs_agent.csv`

### Minimum run count

- at least 5 runs per test case per mode, if time allows

### Work to complete

Only after the local system works:

- deploy the same system or relevant parts to Raspberry Pi
- run the same or simplified scenario
- collect at least limited real-hardware measurements
- document differences between PC and Raspberry Pi behavior

### Important constraint

Raspberry Pi validation must not block the local thesis system from being complete.

If time collapses, the thesis can still survive with the local Tier 1 proof of concept.

- Pi deployment notes
- Pi test logs
- hardware measurement notes
- limitations discussion
